Aim of this project is to collect spareroom listings data for properties located near London tube stations

id_grabber.py grabs data on the first 1000 properties listed near each London tube zone (1-6)

transform_data.py contains some functions used to transform the listings scrape data into a useful format

spareroom_visulisation.ipynb showcases/generates some example plots (inline notebook mapbox plots to come, attached as .html files for now)
